## About

REST endpoints that support user creation, logging in, querying all users if logged in, and logging out.

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
npm run start
```

## Endpoints

### POST /signup

Creates a new user account if one does not already exist for the given email

}
```

Upon success, the errors array will be empty and data.user.email will show the newly added user email.

**Successful Response Body:**

```JSON
{
  "errors":null,
  "data": { "user": {
                      "email":"[your_email]"

## Design and Features

### Hashed passwords

Server breaches and data theft are common occurrences. Storing passwords in a hashed format offers users an added a layer of security.

### JWT Session Menagement

When a user signs up for an account or logs into an existing account, a JSON web token is created that contains an object with that user's email. The object is encrypted using a private key and the token is stored in the user's cookies. When that user attempts to perform an action on the API, their cookies are checked for a valid token and they are considered "logged in" if this token is found.

### Sanitizes and Validates

Sanitizing:

- Replaces ",", ".","&", "'", """, and "/" with their corresponding HTML entities
- Trims leading and trailing white space

Validating:

- Validates email is in proper email format

  - i.e. example@example.com

- Validates password is at least 8 characters long
- Validates password contains an uppercase letter
- Validates password contains a number

### Enforcing Password Standards

In the worst case scenario data breaches, hackers steal all of a company's hashed password data. Because the cost of cracking a hashed pasword increases exponentially with each character, this measure enforces a base level of hashed password security.

- Be at least 8 characters long
- Contain an uppercase letter
- Contain a number

## To Do:

- Limit login Attempts. Although there are tools that implement this, like [express-brute](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-brute), it could instead be delegated to a WAF.
